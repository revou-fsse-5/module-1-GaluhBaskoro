   <h1>A Curious Human Being</h1>
   <p>
    Hi, I'm <b>Galuh Baskoro</b> for now I work as a procurement policy officer at 
    <a href="https://www.len.co.id" target="_blank"  class="link-dark">Len Industry</a> (a defense industry in Indonesia), and considering the current conditions which have entered the digital era, finally I decided to learned software engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
    yups, it's different from my current job and my educational background, but that's how it is. because it occurred to me, if we are too comfortable with the current situation, we will not necessarily have achieved everything, because the world is always changing all the time, therefore we have to prepare for that.
    </p>

  <!-- Why -->
  <section>
   <h1>Learn to Become a Computer</h1>
   <p>
    Nowadays almost every human activity is very dependent on technology. such as communicating between people in various parts of the world can be done in just a matter of seconds, Financial transactions can be done with mobile phones anytime and anywhere, there are even digital currencies like Bit-Coin which can later replace paper money.
   </p>
   <p>
    So there's no harm in improving your skills, because in my opinion that in the future a software engineer will be really needed in various business sectors. Therefore,  becoming an engineer can be a rewarding and fulfilling career choice for several reasons like Problem Solving, Impactful Work, Versatility, Continuous Learning, Global Opportunities, and Financial Stability.

  <!-- What -->
  <section>
   <h1>Advanced Technology to Change the World</h1>
   <p>
    In software engineering there is a lot to learn, starting from basic concepts to the latest technology such as:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>Programming technology (Python, Java, C++, Etc)
    </li>
    <li>Algorithms and Data Structures</li>
    <li>Software Architecture</li>
    <li>Web Development</li>
    <li>Mobile Software Development</li>
    <li>Software Testing</li>
    <li>Software Project Management</li>
    <li>Software Security</li>
    <li>Maintenance and Repair</li>
    <li>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</li>
   </ul>

   <p>
    These are just a few of the topics that can be studied in software engineering. This field is constantly evolving, so it is important to stay updated with the latest developments in the industry.
   </p>

  <!-- How -->
  <section>
   <h1>All Roads Lead to Rome</h1>
   <p>
    Learning and understanding software engineering can feel scary, especially for someone like me, but there are several steps that might make the learning process easier as follows:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>Start with Basic Concepts (fundamentals)</li>
    <li>Choose the programming language that the market needs</li>
    <li>Practice with Small Projects</li>
    <li>Learn from Trusted Sources</li>
    <li>Participate in the Community</li>
    <li>Create a Network</li>
    <li>Consistent and Practicing</li>
    <li>Analysis and Improvement</li>
    <li>Always study</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Following these steps and staying consistent, you will gain a solid understanding in software engineering. Remember that patience and persistence are very important in this learning process.
